You'll have to install pyparsing if you don't already have it, sorry about that. Didn't realise it wasn't a standard library until afterwards.

Command should just be 'pip install pyparsing' - I think that's what I used to install it.

If that doesn't work, here's the official website - https://pypi.org/project/pyparsing/

I hope that works, if not contact me and I'll demonstrate it on my computer. Really put a lot of time into this and would hate for you not to see it working.
